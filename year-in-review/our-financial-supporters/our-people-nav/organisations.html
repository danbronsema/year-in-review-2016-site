      <h2 id="government-funding-and-relationships">Government funding and relationships</h2>

<p>The fiscal environment remains tight at both the federal level and across most states and territories, while competition for government funding continues to grow. Towards the end of the financial year we faced additional funding uncertainty due to the long federal election period, with caretaker conventions preventing any new major tenders or contracts from progressing at that time.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, we secured funding of $800,000 for a two-year contract from the Department of Social Services to enhance belonging and participation for migrants in transition. The renewal of our Humanitarian Agreement with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also provided a $28.8 million multi-year partnership, supporting investment in Asia-Pacific Red Cross partners to prepare for disasters and reduce risks. The certainty provided by this multi-year agreement allows us and our partners to plan for longer-term outcomes and impact. We also secured a number of longer-term contracts with state and territory government departments this year.</p>

<p>Following the commencement of our new CEO, Judy Slatyer in February 2016, we have taken the opportunity to renew and deepen our relationships with ministers and members of parliament. By engaging with governments, we aim to positively influence humanitarian policies and decisions at the highest levels.</p>

<p>In 2016/2017 we will continue this influencing agenda, backed by stronger reporting of the impact of our work and evidence-based policy proposals. We will also be promoting our revised Strategy 2020 goals and outcomes, seeking to direct government priorities to reflect our goals and outcomes. We will continue to proactively seek out government funding opportunities where they align with our goals and will look for more partnerships across government, corporate and other sectors.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-partners">Corporate partners</h2>

<p>We are proud to work with the business community to support the most vulnerable people in Australia and overseas. Not confined solely to financial support, the benefits of these partnerships extend to in-kind support, corporate volunteering and participation in fundraising campaigns. Increasingly we hope to develop partnerships with both financial and nonfinancial outcomes.</p>

<p>Our partners include ALDI, who this year joined forces with us to promote access to sufficient, affordable and healthy food. The partnership is a multi-year agreement that involves a minimum commitment of $300,000 every year, enabling people to gain the knowledge and skills to provide healthy meals for themselves and their family, manage household food budgets and add healthy eating into their overall lifestyle. We look forward to increased outcomes with the support of Insurance Australia Group Limited, who recently provided $1.2 million in funding for the coming years.</p>

<p>Support from trusts and foundations totalled more than $2.4 million, while support from private ancillary funds saw a 29% rise this year.</p>

<p>Generous grants and gifts were received for pilot projects and the continuation of key services. For example, John T Reid Charitable Trusts are enabling a two-year pilot of the Irish Prison Service’s successful CommunityBased Health and First Aid program at Townsville Correctional Facility; while an almost $950,000 grant from Perpetual will support evaluative research of this pilot as well as other sites running the program.</p>
